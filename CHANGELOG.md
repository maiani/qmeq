# QmeQ Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add a prioritized maintenance roadmap in `TODO.md`.

### Changed

- Use NumPy for `pi` and `exp` constants removed from the public SciPy API.
- Allow the Sphinx documentation to build without optional Cython extensions.
- Modernize packaging: move static project metadata to `pyproject.toml`,
  derive the version dynamically from `qmeq.__version__`, use automatic package
  discovery, declare a supported-Python range of `>=3.10`, and reduce `setup.py`
  to building the Cython extensions.
- Configure pytest `testpaths` in `pyproject.toml` so `pytest` discovers the
  suite from the project root.
- Add optional-dependency extras (`test`, `docs`, `dev`) so tooling can be
  installed on demand, e.g. `pip install qmeq[test]` or `pip install -e .[dev]`.
- Refresh `INSTALL.md`: replace the deprecated `python setup.py install` command
  with `pip install .`, document validating an installed build via
  `pytest --pyargs qmeq.tests`, correct the generated documentation path, and
  update stale toolchain guidance and links.

### Removed

- Remove the outdated `README.rst`; `README.md` is now the canonical README and
  is used as the package long description.

### Fixed

- Define all compiled special-function names through pure-Python fallbacks when
  the Cython extensions are unavailable.
- Fix string comparisons used when expanding spin-symmetric input data.
- Fix Sphinx configuration, duplicate API metadata, malformed docstring
  references, and wrapper-page headings so documentation builds cleanly.

### Added

- First-order approaches to describe electron-phonon coupling inside a quantum dot
  * Pauli (classical)
